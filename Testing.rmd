###Software Carpentry Final Assigment 06.17.14
========================================================

This is an R Markdown document constructed for the final assignment of the UC Davis Software Carpentry Bootcamp June 16-17, 2014.

####The Assignment
#####Using an Rmd file (in R), create a short analysis report of the gapminder dataset.
1. Move the data file [you can re-download it here](http://npk.io/BGRY+) into your working directory (the one you have been working with for git and github).
2. Take a look at the file and pick three countries you are interested in.
3. Write an Rmd script to load the data file, select all the data for that country (hint, use the subset() function), and use ggplot make a three scatter plots (one for each country) that has year on the x-axis and GDP on the y axis. Make sure you load all the libraries you might need (ggplot2, reshape2, etc). Describe any trends you see for each country using markdown text.
4. Commit your changes using git. You can do this from the command line or in RStudio if you like.
5. Calculate the mean, min, and max life expectancies for each continent (hint: you use aggregate() if you like). Describe what you see in the results using a markdown text.
6. Commit your changes using git and push them to github.
7. Make 2 histograms of global life expectancy using ggplot. One with the default bin widths and one with narrower bin widths (you can check in the pdf from yesterday's lesson for the syntax you might need to do this). Explain the differences and any interesting trends in markdown text.
8. Commit your changes and push them to github.
9. Compile the final Rmd file to html, make sure it looks ok, and then commit this html file as well (should be in your working directory) and push everything to github.

####The Work Product
#####Loading Datafile and Selecting All Data for Three Countries
Here is an embeded R chunk that sets the working directory, loads required packages, reads in the relevant data file, and selects all the data for Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland, only, then naming the final dataset *dat.three*:

```{r}
setwd("/Users/SE/Desktop/SWC/data")
require(reshape2)
require(ggplot2)
dat<-read.delim("gapminderDataFiveYear.txt")
dat.three<-subset(dat, subset = country %in% c("Sweden","Switzerland","Norway"))
```

Although not part of the assignment, this embeded R chunk further limits the data to just those countries and variables that we're concerned with (ie, Year and GDP data for Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland) and names the final dataset *dat.three.refined*:

```{r}
dat.three.refined<-subset(dat, subset = country %in% c("Sweden","Switzerland","Norway"), select = c(country, year, gdpPercap))
```

#####Embed a Scatter Plot of the Year v GDP Data for the Three Selected Countries
This is an embedded plot, showing three separate scatter plots (made using ggplot2) depicting Year versus GDP data for Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland.  This embeded section further saves the plots as a pdf file named *NorSweSwitYRvGDP*.

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
myplot1<-ggplot(data=dat.three, aes(x=year, y=gdpPercap, color=country)) + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~country)
myplot1
ggsave(myplot1, filename="NorSweSwitYRvGDP.jpg")
```

#####Describe Trends Seen in the Scatter Plot
Trends that can be observed in the above plot include:
1. Norway's GDP has increased by 5x between the 1950s and the 2000s (1952 and 2007, although not visible on this plot).
2. Sweden's GDP has increased by roughly 2.5x between the 1950s and the 2000s.
3. Switzerland's GDP, while roughly 50% greater than either Norway's or Sweden's in the 1950s, has *merely* doubled in the same amount of time.

#####Calculate the Mean, Min, and Max Life Expectancies by Continent
This embeded segment calculates the mean, minimum, and maximum life expectancies by continent (and saves them as dat.mean, dat.min, and dat.max, respectively):

```{r}
dat.mean<-aggregate(lifeExp ~ continent, dat, mean)
dat.min<-aggregate(lifeExp ~ continent, dat, min)
dat.max<-aggregate(lifeExp ~ continent, dat, max)
```

#####Describe Results Observed in the Above Analyses
The continent with the longest maximum average life expectancy is Asia (~83 years of age), closely followed by Eurpoe and Oceania, trailed by Americas and Africa.  Instead, Africa is observed as having the shortest minimum average life expectancy (~24 years of age) and shortest mean life expectancy (~49 years of age).  The other averages tell of high variance in life expectancy in Asia (mean life expectancy ~60 years of age) and the Americas (mean life expectancy ~65 years of age).

#####Embed Two Histograms of Global Life Expectancy (one with defaults and one with narrower bin widths)
This section contains two embeded histograms concerning the above analyzed and described life expectancy data:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
#need to check whether this prints out properly, then describe below, then commit, kint, push
myplot2<-ggplot(dat, aes(factor(continent),lifeExp))+geom_boxplot()
myplot3<-ggplot(dat, aes(factor(continent),lifeExp))+geom_boxplot(width = 0.2)
myplot2
myplot3
```

#####Describe Differences in Above Histograms and Any Interesting Trends
